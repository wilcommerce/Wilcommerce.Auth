# How to contribute
One of the goal of Wilcommerce is growing through the contributions of the community.<br/>
If you have any issue, features or patches to submit, please follow this few guidelines.

## Getting Started
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- Check if your feature or bug is already in our issues.<br/>
If not [create a new issue](https://github.com/wilcommerce/Wilcommerce.Auth/issues) and describe it clearly. 
- If it's a bug include also the steps to reproduce it and tell us the Wilcommerce version you have encountered it on.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes
- Create a new feature branch in your fork starting from the develop branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with ```git diff --check``` before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
- Write unit tests adding your test class to the **Wilcommerce.Auth.Test** project.
- Run **all** the tests to avoid breaking changes.

## Submitting Changes
- Push your changes to your feature branch in your fork.
- [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/wilcommerce/Wilcommerce.Auth/pulls)
